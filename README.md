# Documentation for Bileto Implementation of OSDM API

Bileto implemented part of [OSDM](https://www.osdm.io) (Open Sales and Distribution Model) Specification to enable distributors with unified access to the Bileto Platform. This project documents supported workflows, and provides example to support developers.

## Content

* `examples/direct-reservation-booking`: Example JSON requests and responses for Direct Reservation Booking flow when the trip is pre-searched outside of OSDM.

We suggest using [JSON Diff tool](https://jsoncompare.com) to compare requests and responses of different OSDM API versions.
